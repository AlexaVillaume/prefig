An awesome plotting object to make any plot poster or presentation ready in the colours of your choice! 

A class that can replace the 'plt.figure' python plotting command to create poster and presentaiton ready plots instantly. Plots will be initialised with a transparent background. The font colour and axes colour must be specified - e.g. 'white' for a black background poster. Colours are inverted if 'white' is specified as the colour. Size of fonts changed appropriately according to figure size specified. 
        
        :axcol:
            The colour of the axes of the plot (optional). Default is 'black' or 'k'.
        
        :fontcol:
            The colour of the axes labels and tick labels of the plot (optional). Default is 'black' or 'k'.
        
        :figsize:
            tuple of integers (optional). (width, height) in inches. Default is (16,12).
        :font: 
            font family (optional). Default from rc.font file. Can be specified within plot commands instead.
